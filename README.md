# Task Management System
- Project manages the different tasks assosiated to user.
- It will take the task details and check for basic validations, and stores in database.

## Design Parameters
- Tech Stack -> Python, Django, REST framework.
- I followed Djangoâ€™s app-based structure, dividing the code into separate apps for better maintainability and scalability.
- Added a folder Jobs to schedule the API calls periodically.
- The project adheres to the MVC pattern to clearly separate business logic from the user interface.
- I have used PostgreSQL as my Database for local machine. To make installation easy, I have changed it to SQLite.

## Further Scope
- Can integrate the APScheduler to make a remainder of the tasks due Dates.
- Can integrate to google calenders so that users can get a notification.
